#+TITLE: LG 27GL83A-B macOS EDID Patches

This repository contains patches for the LG 27GL83A's EDID that can be used by
macOS to configure the monitor correctly. Notably these patches:

- Correct the default colour space reported to macOS when connected via. HDMI.
- Force macOS to use RGB colours for HDMI and DisplayPort connections.
- Unlock support for 144 Hz refresh rates over HDMI with FreeSync enabled.

The LG 27GL83A is effectively the same monitor as the LG 27GL850 (it identifies
itself as such) so these patches may work with that monitor too. You might need
to tweak the display product ID to get them working though.

* Instructions
** Safety
If you have a second, different monitor, installing these patches is relatively
safe as, if anything breaks, you can just delete them. If you don't have a
second monitor or your second monitor is another LG 27GL83A connected via the
same type of input, be careful. If something doesn't work you could end up
without a display and without a way to delete the patches.

Of course, saying all that, *you install these patches at your own risk.*

** Requirements
These patches work on Intel Macs running macOS 10.15 and 11.0. They work when
the monitor is connected via HDMI or DisplayPort with FreeSync enabled.

These patches *will not work*:

- With FreeSync disabled over HDMI.
- With HDMI compatibility mode enabled.
- On Apple Silicon Macs (they do not allow EDID overrides).

They *may* work on Intel Macs running older versions of macOS but the
installation script probably won't work.

** Installation
A script in the root of the repository will install these patches for you. It
creates a display override directory at

#+BEGIN_SRC
/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-1e6d
#+END_SRC

and then copies the two override files into it. The ~5b7f~ and ~5b80~ override
files correspond to the DisplayPort and HDMI connectors respectively.

Once the overrides are installed disconnect and reconnect your monitor to
activate the appropriate patches. You can verify they are working by going to
System Preferences > Displays and checking the name of the display. They should
say "27GL850 (HDMI/DP EDID Patched)". If you're using HDMI, you should now see
an option to enabled the 144 Hz refresh rate too.

** Removal
Delete the contents of the
~/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-1e6d~ directory
and then disconnect and reconnect your monitor.

* What's Broken with the LG 27GL83A
The LG 27GL83A has three different EDIDs:

1. DisplayPort EDID
2. HDMI EDID with FreeSync enabled
3. HDMI EDID with FreeSync disabled

These patches only apply to the first and second EDIDs. They won't work with the
third EDID (FreeSync disabled) because FreeSync changes the structure of the
CEA-861 extension block.

** DisplayPort
The DisplayPort EDID is correct but specifies that the monitor supports the
YCbCr 4:4:4 colour space. While this is true, the RGB colour space is generally
preferred for desktop usage. Unfortunately macOS has a tendency to pick the
YCbCr colour space when it's available. This can result in odd looking colours
ranging from subtly wrong to completely incorrect.

The best example (for me) of where this is wrong is with the Messages or
FaceTime icons on macOS. They look almost like a lime green colour when these
monitors are running in YCbCr mode.

** HDMI
The HDMI EDID used by the monitor contains incorrect data that causes issues
with macOS:

1. The width and height encoded in the EDID lead macOS to think that the
   monitor's size is 31".
2. The EDID says that the monitor does not use the sRGB colour space. This
   causes macOS to generate an inappropriate colour profile for the monitor that
   produces dull colours on the monitor.
3. The EDID states that the monitor supports the YCbCr 4:4:4 colour space.

Additionally, when FreeSync is enabled, the refresh rate of the monitor over
HDMI is limited to 100 Hz. While FreeSync may not support refresh rates over 100
Hz [citation needed], macOS doesn't support FreeSync, so it would be nice if we
could bump the refresh rate up to 144 Hz even with FreeSync enabled.

* What Gets Patched
** DisplayPort
1. (Offset 24) The supported features bitmask is updated so the monitor only
   reports supporting RGB 4:4:4.
2. (Offset 131) The YCbCr 4:4:4 and YCbCr 4:2:2 support flags are cleared in the
   CEA-861 extension block.

** HDMI
1. (Offset 21) The horizontal and vertical screen sizes are corrected so that
   macOS reports the correct diagonal screen size of 27".
2. (Offset 24) The sRGB support flag is set in the display features bitmask so
   that macOS uses the correct colour profile.
3. (Offset 66, 208, 226) The horizontal and vertical image sizes for the three
   detailed timing descriptors are corrected so they produce a diagonal image
   size of 27".
4. (Offset 131) The YCbCr 4:4:4 and YCbCr 4:2:2 support flags are cleared in the
   CEA-861 extension block.
5. (Offset 156) The DC_Y444 flag is cleared in the HDMI 1.4 vendor block to
   disable YCbCr 4:4:4 support. This (and point 4 above) makes macOS output a
   full RGB 4:4:4 signal to the monitor instead.
6. (Offset 232) An extra display timing descriptor is inserted into the CEA-861
   extension block that unlocks 144 Hz refresh rates over HDMI with FreeSync
   enabled.

* Technical Notes
** CEA-861 Extension Data Block Contents (HDMI FreeSync Enabled)
The data block section starts at byte offset 132. The contents are as follows:

| Data Block | Byte Offset | Type                     | Length / Bytes |
|------------+-------------+--------------------------+----------------|
|          1 |         132 | Audio                    |              3 |
|          2 |         136 | Video                    |             13 |
|          3 |         150 | HDMI 1.4 Vendor          |             13 |
|          4 |         164 | HDMI 2.0 Vendor          |              7 |
|          5 |         172 | YCbCr 4:2:0 Capabilities |              3 |
|          6 |         176 | AMD Vendor Data          |              8 |
|          7 |         185 | Colorimetry Data         |              3 |
|          8 |         189 | HDR Metadata             |              6 |

The data block ends at byte offset 196 where the first of 2 detailed timing
descriptors starts.

| DTD | Offset | Resolution  | Refresh Rate / Hz |
|-----+--------+-------------+-------------------|
|   1 |    196 | 2560 x 1440 |            74.971 |
|   2 |    214 | 2560 x 1440 |            59.951 |

Data block 6 is missing if FreeSync is disabled. As the patches update the two
DTDs after the data block, they won't work with FreeSync disabled because the
offsets into the DTD block will be different.

** CEA-861 Extension Data Block Contents (HDMI FreeSync Disabled)
The data block stats at byte offset 132. The contents are as follows:

| Data Block | Byte Offset | Type                     | Length / Bytes |
|------------+-------------+--------------------------+----------------|
|          1 |         132 | Audio                    |              3 |
|          2 |         136 | Video                    |             13 |
|          3 |         150 | HDMI 1.4 Vendor          |             13 |
|          4 |         164 | HDMI 2.0 Vendor          |              7 |
|          5 |         172 | YCbCr 4:2:0 Capabilities |              3 |
|          6 |         176 | Colorimetry Data         |              3 |
|          7 |         180 | HDR Metadata             |              6 |

The data block ends at offset 187 (offset 59 inside CEA block) where the first
of three detailed timing descriptors starts.

| DTD | Offset | Resolution  | Refresh Rate / Hz |
|-----+--------+-------------+-------------------|
|   1 |    187 | 2560 x 1440 |            59.951 |
|   2 |    205 | 2560 x 1440 |           119.998 |
|   3 |    223 | 2560 x 1440 |           143.999 |
